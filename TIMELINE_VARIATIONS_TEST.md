# Timeline Modal Variations Test Guide

## Overview

I've created multiple timeline modal variations to fix the issues you reported:

- Tooltips appearing at top or not at all
- SVG icons moving on hover
- Problematic animate-ping animation
- Text overlapping with icons

## Test Instructions

1. Load a G-code file and run the optimization
2. Click the "Timeline" button in the results view
3. You'll see test buttons at the bottom right of the screen:
   - **Original (Current)**: The problematic original implementation
   - **Clean Horizontal**: A cleaner horizontal timeline with better tooltips
   - **Enhanced Cards**: Card-based layout without SVG issues
   - **Vertical Timeline**: Alternative vertical layout

## Variations Explained

### Variation 1: Clean Horizontal

- Fixed node positioning with flexbox instead of SVG
- Icons don't move on hover (transform applied to container)
- Tooltips positioned properly above nodes
- No overlapping text - labels below nodes
- Replaced animate-ping with subtle pulse animation

### Variation 2: Enhanced Cards

- Grid layout with cards instead of timeline
- No SVG hover issues
- No tooltips needed - all info visible in cards
- Click any card to jump to that state
- Responsive grid layout

### Variation 3: Vertical Timeline

- Vertical layout for better space usage
- Timeline on the left, content cards on right
- No tooltip issues - all info in cards
- Clean hover effects without SVG problems

## Fixed Issues

1. **Tooltip Positioning**: Now properly positioned above elements with fixed z-index
2. **SVG Hover Glitches**: Removed transform-origin issues by using container transforms
3. **Animation Problems**: Replaced animate-ping with custom timeline-pulse animation
4. **Text Overlap**: Separated text from icons with proper spacing
5. **Scroll Locking**: Properly preserves and restores scroll position

## CSS Improvements

- Added proper z-index hierarchy
- Fixed transform-origin for all hover effects
- Created custom animations that don't interfere
- Improved spacing and layout consistency

## Implementation Notes

- The test buttons appear at bottom-right when timeline modal is available
- Click between variations to compare
- The original problematic version is included for comparison
- Each variation has its own event handling and tooltip logic

## Next Steps

Once you've tested and chosen a preferred variation:

1. We can make that the default implementation
2. Remove the test buttons and other variations
3. Further customize the chosen design
