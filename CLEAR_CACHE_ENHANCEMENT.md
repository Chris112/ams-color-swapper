# Clear Cache Enhancement

## Overview

The Clear Cache functionality has been enhanced to comprehensively clear all application data, including:

- Application cache repository
- IndexedDB databases (`ams-gcode-cache` and `ams-timeline-db`)
- HMR state (in development mode)

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced ClearCacheCommand

- Now deletes IndexedDB databases in addition to regular cache
- Handles multiple clearing operations in parallel
- Provides detailed error reporting if any operation fails
- Gracefully handles blocked database deletions

### 2. Improved User Feedback

- Loading state with spinner while clearing
- Disabled button during operation
- Success notification showing what was cleared
- Error messages if clearing partially fails

### 3. Visual Enhancements

- Loading spinner animation
- Success checkmark
- Detailed notification popup
- Teal color highlight for success state

## Technical Details

### IndexedDB Deletion

The command now includes:

```typescript
private static readonly INDEXED_DB_NAMES = ['ams-gcode-cache', 'ams-timeline-db'];
```

Each database is deleted using:

```typescript
indexedDB.deleteDatabase(dbName);
```

### Error Handling

- Individual errors are collected and reported
- Operation continues even if one database fails
- Blocked deletions are handled gracefully (database will be deleted when connections close)

### User Interface

- Button shows loading spinner during operation
- Success state shows checkmark and "All Cleared!" text
- Notification popup details what was cleared
- Button returns to normal state after 3 seconds

## Usage

Click the "Clear Cache" button in the interface to:

1. Clear application cache
2. Delete G-code parsing cache (IndexedDB)
3. Delete timeline history (IndexedDB)
4. Clear development state (if in dev mode)

All operations happen simultaneously for better performance.
