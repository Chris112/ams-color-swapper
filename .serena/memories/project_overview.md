# AMS Color Swapper Project Overview

## Project Purpose

AMS Color Swapper is a sophisticated G-code analyzer and optimizer for multi-color 3D prints using Automatic Material Systems (AMS). The tool helps optimize filament assignments for prints with more than 4 colors, minimizing manual swaps and maximizing print efficiency.

## Key Features

- G-code analysis and parsing for multi-color files
- Color mapping to detect which colors are used on which layers
- AMS optimization with smart slot assignment for >4 color prints
- Clear visual instructions for manual filament changes
- Visual timeline showing color usage across all print layers
- Support for multiple printers (Bambu Lab, Prusa MMU, generic multi-material)
- Real-time analysis with progress tracking
- Export options for optimization reports

## Target Users

3D printing enthusiasts using multi-material systems, especially those with:

- OrcaSlicer for slicing
- Bambu Lab AMS systems
- Prints requiring more than 4 colors
