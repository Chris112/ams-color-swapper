# Slowking G-code Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

**No parser regression found.** The `6_color_Slowking.gcode` file is being parsed correctly. The user's expectation that "Color 1 should show 100% coverage" was incorrect - this is actually a complex 6-color Pokemon model, not a single-color print.

## File Analysis Results

### Actual File Contents

- **Total layers**: 266
- **Colors detected**: 6 (T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5)
- **Tool changes**: 321
- **Layer format**: `; layer num/total_layer_count: {number}/266`

### Color Distribution

| Color   | Tool ID | Name    | Usage % | Layers Used | Layer Range |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Color 1 | T0      | Color 1 | 39.5%   | 105/266     | 0-201       |
| Color 2 | T1      | Color 2 | 15.0%   | 40/266      | 6-175       |
| Color 3 | T2      | White   | 16.5%   | 44/266      | 0-196       |
| Color 4 | T3      | Black   | 1.1%    | 3/266       | 163-184     |
| Color 5 | T4      | Color 5 | 25.9%   | 69/266      | 151-265     |
| Color 6 | T5      | Color 6 | 1.9%    | 5/266       | 101-252     |

## Parser Validation

### Layer Detection ✅

- Successfully detected all 266 layer change comments
- Correctly parsed Bambu Studio format: `; layer num/total_layer_count: 1/266`
- Proper 1-based to 0-based layer conversion

### Tool Change Detection ✅

- Identified 321 tool changes throughout the print
- Complex multi-color pattern with frequent tool switching
- Example: Layers 0-50 alternate between T0, T1, and T2

### Color Assignment ✅

- All 266 layers have colors assigned (no gaps)
- Color usage percentages sum to 100%
- Layer timeline visualization should show complex multi-color pattern

## Timeline Visualization Expected Behavior

The layer timeline should show:

- **Early layers (0-50)**: Mix of T0 (Color 1), T1 (Color 2), T2 (White)
- **Middle layers (101-150)**: Primarily T0 with some T2 and T5
- **Late layers (201-266)**: Primarily T4 (Color 5) with some T5

**T0 (Color 1) does NOT appear in late layers**, which is correct for this model.

## Conclusion

1. **No regression exists** - the parser is working correctly
2. **File is 6-color, not single-color** - complex Pokemon Slowking model
3. **39.5% usage for Color 1 is accurate** - not a bug
4. **Layer timeline visualization should reflect this pattern**

## Recommendations

1. Update user expectations: this is a multi-color model
2. Consider the file correctly parsed
3. Timeline visualization accurately represents the complex color distribution
4. No code changes needed - parser working as designed
