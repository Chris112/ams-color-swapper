# AMS Color Swapper - Code Review

## Architecture Issues

The codebase works but has several problems:

**Domain Mixing**: Services and domain models are tightly coupled. The `AmsConfiguration` class does too much - it's both a data structure and contains business logic. Split these responsibilities.

**State Management**: The global `appState` is a singleton anti-pattern. No proper state validation, just a bag of properties that can be mutated anywhere. Use proper state management with reducers or at least validation.

**Error Handling**: Inconsistent error boundaries. Some places catch and log, others throw and crash. The `FileProcessingService` returns generic errors that don't help users understand what went wrong.

**Testing**: Test coverage is poor. The core optimization algorithms have minimal tests. UI components are untested. The existing tests are mostly happy-path scenarios.

## Parser Problems

**Multiple Parser Variants**: 8 different parser implementations with duplicate code everywhere. This is maintenance hell. The factory pattern doesn't solve the underlying code duplication.

**Memory Usage**: The "optimized" parser still loads entire files into memory. For large G-code files (500MB+), this will crash browsers.

**Regex Abuse**: Compiling regex patterns on every line parse. Pre-compile patterns or use string operations.

**Progress Tracking**: The progress calculation is fake. Reading file content first just to count lines is wasteful - estimate better or use streaming.

## Optimization Algorithm Flaws

**Greedy Algorithm Limitations**: The current algorithm is naive. It doesn't consider print time optimization, just layer overlap. A 10-hour print with 5 swaps is worse than a 2-hour print with 8 swaps.

**No Cost Modeling**: Tool changes have different costs depending on when they happen. Swapping during a 30-second layer vs a 5-minute layer should be weighted differently.

**Fixed Slot Strategy**: Hard-coding 3 permanent slots + 1 shared slot is arbitrary. Should be dynamic based on color usage patterns.

## UI Problems

**Canvas Rendering**: The timeline visualization doesn't scale properly. On high-DPI displays it's blurry. On mobile it's unusable.

**Performance**: DOM manipulation in render loops. The results view recreates HTML on every update instead of diffing changes.

**Accessibility**: No keyboard navigation, no screen reader support, poor color contrast ratios.

## Technical Debt

**Bundle Size**: Including Three.js for a simple voxel renderer adds 500KB+ to the bundle for a feature most users won't use.

**Browser Compatibility**: Uses modern APIs without polyfills. Will break on older browsers.

**Web Workers**: The worker implementation is fragile. No error recovery if the worker crashes.

## Missing Features

**Printer Profiles**: Hard-coded for Bambu Lab. No support for other printer ecosystems.

**File Validation**: Accepts any file and tries to parse it. Should validate G-code format first.

**Undo/Redo**: No way to revert configuration changes or go back to previous analysis.

## Performance Issues

**Large File Handling**: Files over 100MB cause UI freezing despite web workers.

**Memory Leaks**: 3D visualization doesn't properly dispose of Three.js objects.

**Inefficient Algorithms**: Color overlap analysis is O(nÂ²) when it could be O(n log n) with proper data structures.

## Recommendations

1. **Refactor parsers** - Create abstract base class, eliminate duplication
2. **Implement proper streaming** - Don't load entire files into memory
3. **Fix optimization algorithm** - Use graph coloring or constraint programming
4. **Add real testing** - Unit tests for algorithms, integration tests for workflows
5. **Performance optimization** - Profile and fix the bottlenecks
6. **Better error handling** - Specific error types with recovery suggestions
7. **Accessibility fixes** - Keyboard navigation, screen reader support
8. **Mobile optimization** - Touch interfaces, responsive layouts

The app works for basic use cases but needs significant improvements for production use.
